PROBLEM LINK : https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false


SOLUTIONS:

1. Sorting the string and comparing the characters one by one
Approach:
Before Sorting
S= "rat"
t= "car"

After Sorting
s= "art"
t= "acr"

Sorting => TC : Worst = (N*N) ; Best = Nlogn
Looping through Length(s) to compare the character values => if s[i]==t[i] (this takes O(N)
Total TC = N*N + N => N*N
